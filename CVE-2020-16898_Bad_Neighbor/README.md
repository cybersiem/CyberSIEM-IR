Before installing the packages

Ensure collecting the event log 1001 from the network’s devices by using WEF.

Collecting the logs only from DC will not be enough.

Note that event 1001 is an Application event – most SIEM systems only collect the security events, so make sure to configure it as well.


ArcSight Package:

We added a mapping file for the relevant windows logs and changed the resources package to match.

The file is available for download from the same path as the .arb package – named winc.zip.

Unzip the file and locate the folder using this path:

\current\user\agent\fcp\

If the ‘winc’ directory already exists, add only the files that do not exist.
